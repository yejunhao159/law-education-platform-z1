# Tasks: ÊïôÂ≠¶‰ºöËØùÂø´ÁÖßÁ≥ªÁªü

**Branch**: `001-teaching-session-storage` | **Date**: 2025-10-24
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-teaching-session-storage/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Tests are NOT included as they were not explicitly requested in the specification.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1, US2, US3, US4) - omitted for Setup/Foundational/Polish phases
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure:
- Backend: `src/domains/teaching-acts/`, `lib/db/`, `app/api/`
- Database: `migrations/`, `lib/db/`
- Frontend: `src/domains/teaching-acts/stores/`, UI components in app/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (T001-T006) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase (T007-T027) completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - Establishes write-first pipeline used by all subsequent stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for reading snapshots written by AI pipeline
  - Should be independently testable with mock data
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses snapshot infrastructure but dialogue table is independent
  - Should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1/US2 snapshot foundation
  - Adds versioning layer on top of existing snapshot system

### Within Each User Story

- Dialogue persistence maintains real-time UX while ensuring complete audit trail
- Version management enables classroom replay without affecting current sessions
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
